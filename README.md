# pokédex

This Pokédex app provides a dynamic list of pokémon and their details. The technologies used to create Pokédex include:

• Javascript

The list of pokémon was obtained from an API via https://pokeapi.co/. The list initially is viewed as clickable cards with the name of each pokémon per card. Once the card is clicked, a modal opens with a front and rear image of the requested pokémon and some details about that creature.

If a user is not at the top of the page and scrolls upward, a "Scroll to Top" button will appear in the lower righthand side. Clicking this button will take the user back to the top of the page.

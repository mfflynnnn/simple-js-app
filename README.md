# simple-js-app

This Simple JS App is a Pokédex, providing a dynamic list of pokémon and their details. The technologies used to create Simpkle JS App include:

• Javascript

The list of pokémon was obtained from an API via https://pokeapi.co/. The list initially is viewed as buttons with the name of each pokémon per button. Once the button is clicked, a modal opens with an image of the requested pokémon and some details about that creature.
